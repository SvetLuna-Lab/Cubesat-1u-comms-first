# 02 — CONOPS (Communications)

## Modes
1) Beacon mode (default, survivable)
- Periodic telemetry frames (health summary)
- Low duty cycle, robust settings

2) Downlink session (scheduled passes)
- Higher duty cycle within thermal/power constraints
- Optional: data file segmentation (future)

## Priorities
Beacon is the heartbeat. If the system is ill or power-starved, beacon persists.
